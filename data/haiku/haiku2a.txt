across fields
across land
all alone
all around
almost gone
among friends
as spring falls
awoken now
back and forth
close at hand
close to heart
disturbed
far away
from the East
from the sky
game of bliss
gently yet
good and bad
in center
in shadows
in silence
in spring night
in still peace
"in the light","in the wind","in twilight","lonely now","morning comes","music
plays","nearby home","over here","over hills","over
there","playfully","side to side","silently","softly still","swift and
just","throughout all","time to time","to the West","to the sky","turn
around","voiceless now","wait and see","wild and fierce","with
caution","with desire","with relief","with rigor","without care","without
fear","without grief","eternally"
