of today
of friendship
in-between
intertwined
of success
of fortune
at the sea
in the rain
in winter
of winter
in summer
of summer
of the spring
in the spring
the applause
of fire
in whispers
in silence
in war time
in peace time
in the past
of futures
of lovers
sweet embrace
through seasons
"of wonder","of ventures","in my mind","in your eyes","of nature","of lost
ruins","of ages","after life","after death","another","of yonder","without
end","of a wish","after rain","of balance","of refuge","of the end","of a
star","of the dead","in the fields","of the lake","of autumn","in
autumn","on the ice","in a pond"
