still in my arms
of love long lost
of memories
of summer's night
between the stars
before spring falls
before fall springs
lost in the rain
emerged at last
with bitter taste
to leave once more
now look for more
stay very close
on dual sides
of my delight
of hope and bliss
without answers
with answers found
as echoes pass
without passion
and cry from far
as time returns
"of gifts received","and sweet goodbyes","of lovers thoughts","in tranquil
minds","behind the end","before the dawn","after sun sets","ahead of
time","in front of joy","ere farewell voiced","around my mind","below true
home","into the end","towards love's grace","without support","until
you're back","within my soul","beyond this world","for spirits
loved","against the waves","among lost hope","outside my grasp","through
sands of time","within this fall","inside my mind","among pure
bliss","across the seas","above the sky"
