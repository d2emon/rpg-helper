I ask of you in my burdened hour
I ask of you in your name
I ask of you with a troubled heart
I beg of you to hear my voice
I beg you to hear my prayer
I come to you in my time of need
I come to you in my times of trouble
I come to you with a heavy heart
I humbly come to you with a troubled heart
I need you in my troubled hour
I need you now in my time of need
grant me your audience
hear me now in my desperate hour
hear my despaired prayer
hear my prayer in my troubled hour
hear my voice in my time of need
hear your humble servant
in my time of need I come to you
listen to my humble prayer
overhear my desperate prayer
please grant me your audience
with troubled heart I come to you
witness me in my time of need
your humble servant calls to you
your humble servant requires your aid
