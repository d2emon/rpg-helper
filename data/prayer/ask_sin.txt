Absolve me of my sins
Clear my soul of darkness
Forgive me for my flaws
Forgive me for my mistakes
Grant me your forgiveness
I accept your punishment
I am truly sorry
I beg your forgiveness
I seek redemption
I wish to repent
Liberate me of my darkness
Liberate me of my sins
Purge me of sin
Relieve me of my sins
Wipe away my sins
