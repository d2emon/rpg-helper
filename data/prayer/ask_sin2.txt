Allow me to repent
Amend my darkened soul
Cast your judgment
Chasten me for my sins
Discipline me as you see fit
I accept my deserved punishment
I accept your chosen verdict
I accept your retribution
I await your conviction
I put my fate in your hands
Pass judgment upon me
Pass your judgment
Punish me as you see fit
Sanction me for my sins
Show me mercy
