as your devout follower
as your faithful child
as your humble servant
completely at your mercy
in your almighty name
in your divine presence
in your eternal light
in your eternal presence
in your hallowed name
in your most holy name
on both my knees
with a sincere heart
with absolute devotion
with open arms
with true devotion
