Absolve me
Forgive me
Have mercy on me
I deserted you
I don't know what come over me
I failed you
I fell from the path
I had a terrible lapse in judgment
I made a mistake
I was blinded
I was feebleminded
I was foolish
I was stupid
I went astray
I'm so sorry
I'm sorry
I've let you down
My apologies
My mind was weak
My sincerest apologies
