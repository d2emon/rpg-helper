I won't fail you again
absolve me of these demons
allow me to mend my ways
allow me to prove myself once more
brighten the darkness in my soul
bring light to my darkened soul
cure me of my flaws
deliver me from evil
give me a second chance
grant me a chance to restore my faith
grant me another chance
have mercy on my soul
heal me of these self inflicted wounds
relieve me of my demons
unburden me of this pain
