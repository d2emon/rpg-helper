I come before you to confess me sins
I come to you to confess my sins
I come to you with a remorseful heart
I have a confession to make for I have sinned
I have sinned in a moment of weakness
I lost your  light and stepped into darkness
I need to relieve my heart of darkness
I strayed from the path and stepped into darkness
I strayed from your path
I wandered from your path and come to confess my sins
I wish to confess my mistakes
ashamed I admit that I have sinned
temptation took hold of me in a moment of weakness
with a heavy heart I come to you
with guilty heart I come to you
