I accepted a bribe in a moment of greed and weakness
I brawled in an intoxicated moment of total weakness
I broke a promise I should've kept
I craved wealth and let greed get the better of me
I cursed with your name in a moment of sorrow
I cursed your name in a moment of anger
I desired more power to change the world
I did not love others as you do
I did not read your scriptures on the most holy day
I did not spread your word as well as I could
I have not loved you with all my heart
I let drink take over my mind
I made a vulgar joke at the expense of another
I neglected to congregate with the saints
I passed judgment where it wasn't my right to do so
I played with temptation and paid the price
I pretended not to know you when I was under pressure
I put my job before you
I slept through a sermon after a sleepless night
I spoke ill of a fellow devout follower
I spoke ill of my own parents
I spread a rumor at the expense of another
I succumbed to earthly desires
I took part in a game of chance with money I should've saved
I took what isn't mine
I was angry at you and your ways
I was led to believe there was another god besides yourself
I was tempted by the flesh of another
I withheld part of the truth when asked for it
my anger led me to seek my own justice
my anger turned to an uncontrollable rage
my annoyances led to a rivalry based on anger
my envy led me to take that which doesn't belong to me
my greed led me to embezzle money for my family's sake
my laziness led me to skip a day's worth of work
my lust got the better of me in a moment of weakness
my passion led me to ignore those I loved
my pride led me to attack another in a moment of of weakness
my pride led me to disobey my own parents
my pride led me to lie
