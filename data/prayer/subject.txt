ache no longer
be alleviated of my anguish
be delivered from evil
be filled with joy
be lost no longer
be relieved of my pain
be strong once more
conquer your foes
exchange my sadness for joy
find my path
go forth in your name
guide others in your name
illuminate the darkness
lift my burdens
lighten my encumbrance
live in peace
make the right choice
overcome my grief
overcome my obstacles
proclaim your praise
repel the evil forces
save my eternal soul
save others
shed my hardships
show the world your greatness
slay my enemies
soothe my inner turmoil
step out of the shadows
strengthen my resolve
vanquish my demons
